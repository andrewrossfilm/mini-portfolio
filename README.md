Edinburgh University Mini-Portfolio Submission.

This is my mini-portfolio submission for applying to The University of Edinburgh BA Film and Television. 

The main script for my submission is "Closing Time". This is the screenplay for a short film I planned on shooting for this portfolio, 
but due to Covid-19 restrictions I was unable to get people together to film it. I've added notes to the script to indicate what I was roughly planning on doing with
the camera for each section. I hope this can give a reasonable overview of what I was trying to accomplish and the story I wanted to tell.

I've also included another screenplay I wrote, "Voices in the Air", as supplementary material, if required.
